          The First Order, also known simply as the Order, was an autocratic military junta that formed from the remnants of the Galactic Empire during the New Republic Era. Born in the Unknown
          Regions of the galaxy, the First Order claimed legitimacy as a successor state to the Empire. As with its predecessor, the First Order was dominated by a ruling political and military human
          elite. As a polity, the First Order was ruled by a Supreme Leader from their mobile headquarters instead of a traditional planetary capital. It grew from a hermit state to the dominant
          galactic power, having gradually colonized large swathes of the Unknown Regions and boosted by secessionists from the New Republic, annexing the territory that would serve a crucial role in
          the regime's plan to eventually seize the galaxy at large. Yet despite their conquest of the major star systems, the First Order's military rule was met with resistance and rebellion.
